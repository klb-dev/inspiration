# ABOUT
An inspirational program. Giving users simple quotes about what life can be. It is very simple, but effective.

# TOOLS
- HTML - HyperText Markup Language defines structure of content 
- CSS - cascading Style Sheets describes the presentation of the HTML document
- JavaScript (JS) - programming language to implement complex features.
-Responsive to 3 screen sizes.

# LEARNING
- The HTML is short and to the point, but I learned more about accessibility. I use aria-label because my button does not have an writing, aria-live because I am using JavaScript to change the text of a paragraph.
  
- The CSS is not too long, but does have the most writing. I learned about linear-gradient and how to apply it not only to a background but also I applied to text. 

- The JavaScript has a function to show the different quotes I am pulling from an API. I main focused on the fetch() process while also updating style with .classList located within my stylesheet. 

- This is the first project I have done using APIs and I really thing the beginning of learning them was easier than I anticipated. I still have a long way to go about understanding the GET and also the TRY/CATCH. 


# RESOURCES 
I am new to the learning Frontend Development and I will say that Google has become a part of my development experience. Experienced developers alway say that Google will become your best friend.

- [Mozilla Document Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a community of developers that help other developers. Being new it is easy for me to understand the syntax of each language with MDN.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is an organization to help further learning on new trends.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is another resource used by developers. Asking questions sometimes can take a while, but the knowledge on this site is amazing.

- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) has been instrumental in my learning. Day by day I am learning new things while also searching Google to find answers to help develop me.

# What is next
I want to make it a better inspirational app. Possibly pulling some more APIs with a greater amount of quotes. I also want to make it tailored to individuals about what the need the inspiration (ie: working out, looking positively each day).
